Regardless of your class year, Upper/CoRo has the advatage of being the dorms closest to classes."

The plex (if you are into that sort of thing) is where you will work out (unless you got luck and you live on Newton). Most of the sports facilities are on lower. Now is a good time to mention that we are a D1 school. We have one of the best hockey teams in the nation. The same cannot be said for most of the other sports."
